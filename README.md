# Coding at GIKI

**This repository contains all the code I have or will have written by the end of my 8 sem journey at GIKI. This repository will be regularly updated by the end of every semester.
The files in this repositiory will contain all manner of code files including 2-3 liners. Larger Projects, however, will not be included here.
I want this repository to be a catalogue of my journey from a complete novice to a decent programmer.**
